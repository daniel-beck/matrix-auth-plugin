                    I see two possible approaches here:
                    One would be to just grant every permission if the root ACL grants Administer.
                    This could result in weird situations where disabling inheritance would grant permissions like the optional
                    Run/Artifacts permission not implied by anything else.
                    The chosen, second approach checks whether the given permission is ultimately (transitively) implied by
                    Administer, and, if so, grants it if the user has Administer.
                    As this is a tree, any permission implication rooted in Administer should then be granted to administrators.
